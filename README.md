[![Replicate Model](https://replicate.com/skytells-research/flux/badge)](https://replicate.com/skytells-research/flux)

Flux Toolkit is an advanced toolset designed to facilitate the training and deployment of machine learning models using the powerful [Flux model](https://replicate.com/skytells-research/flux) from Skytells Research. This toolkit streamlines the process of integrating AI-driven capabilities into your applications, leveraging the strengths of the Flux model.

## Features

- **Model Training**: Seamless integration with the Flux model for training on custom datasets.
- **Deployment**: Tools for deploying trained models directly into production environments.
- **Batch Processing**: Support for large-scale data processing and model inference.
- **Customizable**: Fully configurable to meet your specific machine learning needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Git
- Python 3.8+
- Pip
- [Replicate CLI](https://replicate.com/docs/getting-started#install-replicate)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skytells-research/flux-toolkit.git
    cd flux-toolkit
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up your environment**:

    Create a `.env` file with your configuration:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file with your API keys and configuration details.

### Usage

#### Training a Model

1. Prepare your dataset and ensure it is accessible via a public URL or stored locally.

2. Run the training script:

    ```bash
    python train.py --dataset-url <your-dataset-url> --steps 1400 --batch-size 1
    ```

    Adjust the parameters as needed to customize the training process.

#### Deploying the Model

Once training is complete, deploy the model using the Replicate CLI:

```bash
replicate deploy --model skytells-research/flux --destination <your-deployment-destination>
